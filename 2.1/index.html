	<h1>css tips - floating and positioning</h1>

	<h2>1. You are all starting to write a lot more code, and nesting  tags within many other tags. Make sure your outside tags are visually on the outside when you are typing html, and the inner divs are inside the parent tags. Use tabs or spaces to indent your code.</h2>

	<div>
		<h3>
			Experienced devs will feel like this if they look at someone's unindented code:

	<h2> So please spend time indenting your code. It's the best way to catch syntax errors and extra tags in your files. It will be even more important when you are coding javascript so get used to it! Also, notice how tags have a slight white dotted line when you click on them. If you don't see this on a tag, then you most likely have a syntax error or not enough closing tags</h2>

	<h2>2. Block elements take up the entire width of the parent container. Notice how when you add the outer div, which is 50%, the div content shrinks. The inner div width is still technically 100% of the container. </h2>

	<h2>Absolute and Relative positioning usually go together. Absolute positioning will allow you to use the positioning properties - top, right, bottom, left (TRBL) in relation to the parent container. </h2>

	<h2> If you moved this jaws poster anywhere on the screen, the text will stay aligned properly, because it's absolutely positioned to the outside div tag. Notice what happens when I move the poster to the right:</h2>

	<h2>Now watch what happens when you remove the absolute position: The text now becomes positioned 130px from the top and 30px from the left, but in relation to the body tag, because there is no relative positioning available</h2>

	<h2>Not seeing any styles being applied?  Want to see how other sites are doing layout or styling? Use Chrome Dev Tools to Debug CSS! You can change any CSS here. Just remember your changes go away after your close the inspector or refresh the page.</h2>

	<h1>Most importantly practice! You will continue to build on your HTML and CSS skills as we go through the course. There is no special talent required to be a developer. Just experience!</h1>
